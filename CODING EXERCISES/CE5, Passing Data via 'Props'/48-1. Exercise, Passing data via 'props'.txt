Exercise: Passing Data via "props"
You're working on the UI prototype for an online shop and your task is to output two product items (via the <Product /> component you find in the Product.js file) below the main page title ("My Demo Shop") in the App component.

The final UI should look like this:
(picture in the same file)

The two product items should use the same component (<Product />) but output different data (title, price & description). Data should be passed to the components (and output there) via props.

The first product item is expected to display the following information:

Title: Product 1

Price: 10

Description: First product

The second product item is expected to display the following information:

Title: Product 2

Price: 20

Description: Second product

HINTS
Make sure you output two, not just one, product items in the App component

To re-use the same component for different data, props are needed

Pass the different title, price and description data via props to the <Product /> component

Receive and output the props data via the props object parameter inside of the Product component function





<div>
                <article className="product">
            <h2>{Product[0].title}</h2>
            <p className="price">{Product[0].price}</p>
            <p>{Product[0].description}</p>
        </article>
            </div>
            <div>
                <article className="product">
            <h2>{Product[1].title}</h2>
            <p className="price">{Product[1].price}</p>
            <p>{Product[1].description}</p>
        </article>
            </div>
