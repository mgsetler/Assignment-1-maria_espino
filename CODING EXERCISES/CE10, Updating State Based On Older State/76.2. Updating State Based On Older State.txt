Exercise: Updating State Based On Older State
Your task is to build a basic counter that should increment whenever the "Increment" button is clicked.

Whilst this task allows you to apply your general knowledge about event handling and state (which you already practiced quite a bit at this point in the course), there's also one crucial new aspect: You should update the state following React best practices!

Important: Unfortunately, there's no way of automatically testing whether you used the best practice approach or not. Hence you should take a look at the "Solution explanation" to make sure you solved this task in the best possible way.

Also make sure to use React.useState() instead of just useState() as the latter might fail in Udemy's code environment!


LEARNING OBJECTIVE:
Create a working counter with help of React state.
