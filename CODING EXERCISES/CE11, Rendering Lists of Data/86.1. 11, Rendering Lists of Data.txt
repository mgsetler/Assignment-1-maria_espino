86.1. Exercise, Rendering Lists of Data


You're working on a "Todo List" web app and your task is to output a list of dummy todo items dynamically. For this task, a Todo component has been prepared for you, though you must still add some code to it to receive and output the todo text.

To be more precise: In the App component, you should transform the DUMMY_TODOS array that's provided to you (which must not be changed!) to a list of JSX elements (<Todo> elements to be precise). Every Todo component item must receive and output the todo text via a prop called text.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE:
Output a static list of todo items in a React component.




*************************
HINTS
Arrays can (and should) be transformed into JSX elements via the built-in map() method

Keep in mind that someArray.map(...) must be wrapped with curly braces if used in JSX code

map() takes a function that automatically receives the individual array item as an argument and returns the new value (to which the item should be transformed)

To pass the todo text (which is different for every todo item) to the Todo component, you should use a text prop (props.text inside the Todo component, <Todo text="..."> inside the App component)


*****************************
solution explanation
---
As a first step, you should make sure that the Todo component is able to receive and output a text prop:

import React from 'react';
 
export default function Todo(props) {
    return <li>{props.text}</li>;
}


With that out of the way, you can re-use this Todo component for different todo items.

Therefore, as a next step, you should dynamically map the DUMMY_TODOS array to an array full of <Todo /> JSX elements (which then can be output as part of the App component's JSX code). This is achieved via the built-in map() method (called on DUMMY_TODOS):

import React from 'react';
 
import Todo from './Todo';
import './styles.css';
 
const DUMMY_TODOS = [
    'Learn React',
    'Practice React',
    'Profit!'
];
 
// don't change the Component name "App"
export default function App() {
    return (
        <ul>
          {DUMMY_TODOS.map(todo => <Todo text={todo} />)}
        </ul>
    );
}
In this code, you see that a (anonymous) function is passed to the map() method. This function is automatically executed by JavaScript - once for every item in DUMMY_TODOS. It automatically receives the item, for which it's currently executed, as an argument and must return the new value to which the item is transformed.

In this case, the old item values (which are plain strings like "Learn React") are transformed to <Todo /> JSX elements. The text property is set on <Todo /> to pass the todo item text to the Todo component.
