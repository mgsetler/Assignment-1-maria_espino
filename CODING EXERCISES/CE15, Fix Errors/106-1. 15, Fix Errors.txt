
Exercise: Fix Errors
For this exercise, imagine that colleagues gave you code they wrote for a React app they're working on.

At the moment, this code is failing and it's your job to find and fix all errors that are hiding in the code.


HINTS
It's more than one error you'll have to find & fix

Look for typos and consider core React (component) rules

You can open the JavaScript console in your browser developer tools to see any error messages that might be thrown. There, amongst a huge amount of warning messages (coming from Udemy, not related to your app), you should see this error message which helps with fixing at least one of the app's errors:



SOLUTION EXPLANATION
----------------------------------
The provided starting code has two errors in it:

<Div> should be <div>

onclick should be onClick

<Div> should be <div>

In React apps, your own, custom components must start with an uppercase character. But those built-in, default HTML element components (like <p>, <input>, <div> etc.) all start with a lowercase character.

That applies to both the opening and closing tag: It should be <div>...</div> instead of <Div>...</Div>.

onclick should be onClick

Event listeners are added to components via the onXYZ props (where XYZ defines the event name) - for "click" events, onClick should be used therefore.

The casing matters here! 

onclick is not the same as onClick - and indeed onclick is wrong and won't work.

Hence, to fix this error, <button onclick={...}> must be changed to <button onClick={...}>.
