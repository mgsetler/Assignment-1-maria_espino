/*
Exercise: Working with JSX Code
This is a quick exercise to get started with React and JSX code: Your task is to edit the JSX code of a provided React component such that it displays a h1 element with the text "Exercise done!" on the page.

Important: The custom JSX code must be added inside the existing <div> element.

HINTS:
Make sure to add your <h1> element inside of the existing <div> element

Watch out for typos - the solution is checked automatically (and hence typos cause it to fail)
