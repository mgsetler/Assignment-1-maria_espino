Exercise: Listening to Events
Imagine you're working on a brand-new React app that should allow users to bookmark articles (e.g., news articles).

To start with your work, your task is to "connect" a click event listener to an already existing button and output "Stored!" via console.log(). And, of course, you should do that "the React way".
